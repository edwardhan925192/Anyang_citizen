column = x,y coordinates 
row = x,y coordinates for each second 
batch = full time that one person usually walks. 

Each batch 
-------
12  14 
14  13
13  16
12  14 
14  13
13  16
-------

where the term between the rows will going to be whatever t that we set to. 

Find loss for the whole batch 
and if the total mean loss sort of spikes we label those as anomalies.
